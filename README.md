_***AssignmentNo. 1 >***_

Student_Database_using_class_n_sorting.cpp ->

      Assignment 1 : Searching and Sorting
   
         Consider a student database of SEIT class (at least 15 records). Database contains different
         Fields of every student like Roll No, Name and SGPA.(array of structure)
         a. Design a roll call list, arrange list of students according to roll numbers in ascending
            order (Use Bubble Sort)

         b. Arrange list of students alphabetically. (Use Insertion sort)

         c. Arrange list of students to find out first ten toppers from a class. (Use Quick sort)

         d. Search students according to SGPA. If more than one student having same SGPA,
            then print list of all students having same SGPA.

         e. Search a particular student according to name using binary search without recursion.
            (all the student records having the presence of search key should be displayed)
            (Note: Implement either Bubble sort or Insertion Sort.)

_***AssignmentNo. 2 >***_

On Branch named -
Assignment_2-Queue ->

      Assignment 2 : Circularqueue
   
         Implement Circular Queueusing Array. Perform following operations on it.
         a) Insertion (Enqueue)
         b) Deletion (Dequeue)
         c) Display

_***AssignmentNo. 7 >***_

On Branch named -
Assignment_7-MST ->

      Assignment 7 : Minimum Spamming Tree
   
          Represent a graph of your college campus using adjacency list /adjacency matrix. Nodes should represent the various departments/institutes and links should represent
          the distance between them. Find minimum spanning tree using,
          a) Using Kruskal’s algorithm
          b) Using Prim’s algorithm

On Branch named -
Assignment_8-Dijikstra's_Algorithm ->

      Assignment 8 : Dijkstra's Algorithm
   
          Represent a graph of city using adjacency matrix /adjacency list. Nodes should represent the various landmarks and links should represent the distance between them.
          Find the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm from single source to all destination. Analyze the implemented algorithm for space and time complexity

_***AssignmentNo. 10 >***_

On Branch named -
Assignment_10-File_Handling ->

      Assignment 10 : File Handling
   
          Department maintains student’s database. The file contains roll number, name, division and address. Write a program to create a sequential file to store and maintain
          student data. It should allow the user to add, delete information of student. Display information of particular student. If record of student does not exist an
          appropriate message is displayed. If student record is found it should display the student details.
